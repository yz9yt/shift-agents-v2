# Shift Agents v2

## Overview
Shift Agents v2 is a powerful micro-agent framework for Caido users, designed to streamline web traffic analysis and security testing. This version introduces a robust architecture focused on advanced model orchestration, cost control, and enhanced user experience. It allows for the creation of personalized, AI-powered agents to perform complex tasks such as exploiting vulnerabilities and bypassing security measures.

## Key Features
*   **Model Orchestrator**: The agent can dynamically select the most suitable AI model for each task, balancing performance, reliability, and cost.
*   **Request Controller**: Safeguards against unexpected API costs with features like request throttling and a "circuit breaker" to stop runaway agents.
*   **Auto Mode**: A new autonomous mode that enables the agent to perform a complete end-to-end security assessment without constant user intervention.
*   **Extended Toolset**: The agent's capabilities have been expanded with new tools for better context-aware testing.
*   **Improved User Interface**: The plugin UI now includes dedicated tabs for settings, documentation, and error logging for a better user experience.

## Architectural Changes
### Model Orchestrator
The model orchestration system replaces the single model selection with a dynamic, multi-model approach. This allows the agent to switch between models based on the task, optimizing for cost or performance.

**Orchestration Modes**: The user can choose from three distinct modes in the General Settings:

*   **Automatic**: The agent intelligently selects the most capable and recommended model for each task.
*   **Economy**: The agent prioritizes cost-effective models (e.g., "mini", "lite", or "free" models).
*   **Manual**: The user defines a specific sequence of up to five models for the agent to cycle through.

### Request Controller
This new component prevents unwanted API costs and infinite loops.

*   **Throttling**: A configurable delay is added between API calls to prevent a rapid burst of requests.
*   **Circuit Breaker**: The agent will automatically stop after a specified number of consecutive API errors, preventing it from wasting tokens on a non-functional connection.

### Enhanced Toolset
The agent's tool library has been extended to include more powerful, context-aware tools:

*   `revertRequest`: Allows the agent to undo the last modification to an HTTP request.
*   `getHttpHistory`: Enables the agent to query the Caido project's HTTP history for valuable context.

## User Interface
The plugin's user interface has been significantly improved for better organization and usability.

### Multi-Tab Layout
The main settings page now features a tabbed interface with dedicated sections for:

*   **General Settings**: Configure API keys, orchestration modes, and safety controls.
*   **Custom Prompts**: Manage a library of custom prompts, including new import and export functionality.
*   **Documentation**: A comprehensive guide explaining all of the agent's features, modes, and tools.
*   **Error Log**: A dedicated log for tracking and debugging agent errors.

### Redesigned Chat Input
The chat area has been optimized for responsiveness and usability, with the text input field being resizable and controls more logically placed.

## Installation
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Build the plugin:** Execute the build command from the project root. This command specifically targets the frontend package to build the plugin efficiently.
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter frontend build
    ```

3.  **Install in Caido:**
    Upload the `dist/plugin_package.zip` file in Caido by clicking on the "Install Package" button in the plugins section of the application.
